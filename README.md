## ▶️ How to Use

### Option 1: Open Locally (No Server)

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser
2. Browse categories or use the search bar
3. Click a chart to view it fullscreen

⚠️ Some browsers (like Chrome) may block local file access for dynamic JS apps. If charts or thumbnails don't show up, use the local server option below.

### Option 2: Start Local Server (Recommended)

1. Double-click `start_server.bat`
2. It will:
   - Launch a Python HTTP server on port `8000`
   - Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser
   - Automatically close the batch window

3. A separate command window will stay open running the server  
   ❌ Close it or press `CTRL + C` to stop the server

## ⭐ Favorites

Favorites are saved in your browser (via `localStorage`). They persist across visits, unless you clear your browser data.
